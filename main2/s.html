<h1>WHAT YOU DID NOT KNOW</h1>

	Do you have trouble accepting yourself when you make mistakes? Do you find it hard to learn from your mistakes, so that you keep falling into the same old habits? It can be challenging to accept that we've made mistakes, especially if we are coming from a perfectionistic background where "excellence" is confused with "never making a mistake." Making a mistake is also sometimes different from failure; failure is a result of not succeeding at a conscious effort, but mistakes can be unconscious. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to be more accepting of your mistakes, and there are also techniques you can use to make the most of your mistakes.

	Distinguish between mistakes and bad decisions. It is important to know the difference between mistakes and bad decisions. Mistakes are simple errors, like reading a map wrong and taking the wrong exit. Bad decisions are more intentional, like taking the scenic route to a meeting and inconveniencing the other person by being late. Mistakes are understandable and may require less focus on correcting. You should accept bad decisions just like mistakes, but it pays to pay more attention to them.

	Find which behaviors you want to change. Before you can avoid making the same mistakes or repeating the same behaviors, you will have to identify the behaviors you want to change. Examine your life for any behaviors that you want to work on.
    Try finding the habits and old behaviors that you think are the most important to work on first.
    Do NOT take on too much at once. Focus on a select few issues that you feel deserve the most attention.
    What you will always do after a mistake.
	Forgive yourself if you keep making the same mistake. It's okay to have one area that gives you a lot of difficulty.
	<h3>Warnings</h3>
	Avoid thinking you're immune to mistakes, even if you're good at something. This can make it harder for you if you do mess up.

 An acknowledgment of your responsibility in the matter. Like, "I messed up." "I was wrong about ___." "I owe you an apology." "I should have been more careful when handling that ceramic cup."
These “I’m sorry” quotes will help you apologize in a way that reflects how you truly feel.

Nobody is perfect. We all make mistakes and do things that hurt other people at some point in our lives. That’s why it’s important to acquire the ability to acknowledge your mistakes and apologize for your wrongs, even if you didn’t do it on purpose.
“I have made terrible mistakes that have hurt the people that I cared about the most, and I am terribly sorry. I am deeply ashamed of my terrible judgment and my actions.” 
“Dear mom, I ask you to please forgive me for having behaved in that way, I will make my best to be better as my goal is to make you happy.”
 “Every time I am wrong it is you who I hurt most, so I ask you to please forgive me I promise to be a better daughter.”
 The cycle of the perfect apology starts with a Mistake followed by Regret, followed by a Sorry, followed by Forgiveness. I did the first three, please complete the last. I am sorry mom.
You filled my soul with love and care, but I left your heart glum and bare. You filled my life with all things nice, but I filled yours with worries and cries. Sorry mom.
I was wrong, I accept it now. There are no excuses worthwhile.



I'm sorry for tricking you.
Again.
I'm sorry for lying to you.
Again and again.
I'm sorry for letting you down.
Again and again and again. 
I'm sorry for leaving you with nothing to say because you are so disappointed when really most of the time you are the one person I feel is proud of me. 
Again. 

I love you. 
You are all I have left. 
Please still love me back.
